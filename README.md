## Features
* At present all the difficulties which were present before has been eliminated like for eg: Data Redundancy, Data missing or Data corrupt issue. 
* The existing system was outdated and had too many dependency on physical labour. 
* The proposed system has covered all the points and has been desiged accordingly.

To-do list:
* As of now there is no issue regarding the website. 
* Later we could add an alert and OTP feature onto the website which will help the user in a more practical way.
* We also have a plan to add a embedded map feature inside the website which will help the user to locate the actual workplace if needed. 
* An emergency feature is also needed for the assets which are targeted for insurance.


## Status
Project is in complete state as of now. Feel free to update the code which might be useful for the project but let us validate it once. 

## Inspiration
To improve the work place and the method of keeping records made us inspire for taking up such project in our internship. This not only helped us to work on such great project but the practicality of the project also helped the actual users of the website. For security purpose some of the files are missing which contains the actual data. The data whcih we are using here is dummy data.
